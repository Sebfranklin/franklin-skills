# Veo 3.1 Prompting
## Core Capabilities
Veo 3.1 generates video with native audio synthesis and advanced physical realism. Key specifications:
 * **Resolutions**: 720p, 1080p, or 4K
 * **Aspect Ratios**: 16:9 (landscape) or 9:16 (portrait)
 * **Duration**: 4, 6, or 8 seconds per generation (billed as 8s minimum)
 * **Framerate**: 24 FPS (cinematic standard)
 * **Native Audio**: Dialogue, ambient sound, and music synchronized to video
 * **Reference Images**: Up to 3 images for character/style consistency ("Ingredients to Video")
 * **Advanced Controls**: First/Last Frame interpolation, Timestamp Prompting for multi-shot narratives
## The Five-Part Formula
Structure every prompt in this order:
**[Cinematography] + [Subject] + [Action] + [Context] + [Style & Audio]**
**Example:**
> Tracking shot following a weathered fisherman mending nets on a wooden dock. Golden hour sun flares through rigging. Salt spray visible in air. Cinematic 35mm film grain. Sound: seagulls crying, rope creaking, gentle waves.
> 
**Critical:** Lead with camera movement. Veo 3.1 weights early tokens heavily.
## 1. Cinematography Specifications
Always specify shot type, camera movement, and lens characteristics first.
**Shot Framing**
 * Extreme close-up, Close-up, Medium shot, Wide establishing shot
 * Over-the-shoulder, POV, Bird's eye view, Worm's eye view
**Camera Movement**
 * Linear: Dolly in/out, Tracking shot, Pan, Tilt, Truck
 * Dynamic: Handheld, Gimbal smooth, Whip pan, Rack focus
 * Aerial: Drone descending, Orbit clockwise, Crane up
**Lens & Focus**
 * Shallow depth of field with creamy bokeh
 * Deep focus everything sharp
 * Anamorphic lens with horizontal flares
 * Macro lens for extreme detail
## 2. Subject Specification
Describe subjects with exhaustive visual detail for consistency:
**Character Anchors** (Essential for multi-clip consistency)
 * Physical: "Elderly man, silver hair cropped short, weathered face with scar above left eyebrow"
 * Clothing: "Faded navy pea coat, brass buttons tarnished, wool scarf with fringe"
 * Distinctive markers: "Red-rimmed glasses", "tattoo of anchor on forearm", "gold pocket watch chain"
**Object Details**
 * Material and condition: "Brushed titanium, fingerprint-smudged", "distressed leather with patina"
 * Interaction points: "Steam rising from ceramic rim", "condensation beads on cold glass"
## 3. Action & Physics
Use dynamic verbs demonstrating physical interaction:
 * **Motion quality**: strides confidently, shuffles nervously, explodes outward, cascades smoothly
 * **Physics indicators**: realistic water displacement, accurate gravity, cloth simulation, hair physics
 * **Temporal markers**: gradually accelerating, suddenly freezing, continuously swirling
**Physics Strengths**: Fluid dynamics, fire/smoke, fabric movement, particle systems (dust, snow, sparks).
## 4. Context & Atmosphere
Establish environment and mood:
**Lighting**
 * Time: dawn blue hour, golden hour, harsh midday, neon-lit night
 * Quality: volumetric god rays, chiaroscuro shadows, soft diffused overcast, practical lamp light
 * Effects: lens flare, bloom, atmospheric haze
**Environment**
 * Spatial: cramped interior, vast open landscape, claustrophobic corridor
 * Weather: rain-streaked windows, fog-choked streets, snow-dusted
## 5. Style & Audio Synthesis
**Visual Style**
 * Genre: cinematic noir, BBC Earth documentary, Pixar 3D animation, vintage 16mm
 * Color: teal and orange blockbuster grade, bleach bypass desaturated, vibrant anime saturation
 * Texture: film grain 35mm, digital sharpness, VHS tracking lines
**Native Audio**
 * Dialogue: "Smooth baritone voice: 'The package has arrived.'"
 * Ambient: "Coffee shop murmur, ceramic cup placed on saucer"
 * Effects: "Satisfying mechanical keyboard clack", "metallic slide and lock"
 * Music: "Tense strings building to crescendo", "lo-fi hip hop beat 80bpm"
**Audio Sync Tips**
 * Time dialogue: "At 2-second mark, character speaks"
 * Match motion: "Music swells as camera pushes in"
 * Layer sounds: "Base ambiance, then specific Foley, then dialogue"
## Advanced Workflows
### Ingredients to Video (Character Consistency)
Use when maintaining characters across multiple clips:
 1. Upload 1-3 reference images (character face, outfit, environment)
 2. Prompt structure: "Same woman from reference image, now walking through rainy Tokyo street. Maintaining red leather jacket and bob haircut."
 3. Keep anchors consistent: "Same scar on cheek, same gold hoop earrings"
### First & Last Frame Interpolation
Create specific transitions:
 1. Describe starting state: "Sealed envelope on mahogany desk"
 2. Describe ending state: "Open envelope, letter partially pulled out, handwritten text visible"
 3. Veo generates smooth 8-second transition between states
 4. Use for: reveals, transformations, camera moves through portals
### Timestamp Prompting (Multi-Shot Narrative)
Break 8 seconds into precise segments for narrative control:
 * **0-2s:** Wide shot of empty desert highway, heat shimmer rising
 * **2-4s:** Close-up of motorcycle speedometer needle climbing
 * **4-6s:** Tracking shot of rider leaning into turn, dust cloud trailing
 * **6-8s:** Wide shot motorcycle disappearing into sunset, engine roar fading
## Model Selection
| Model | Speed | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| veo-3.1-generate-001 | Standard | High-quality commercial content, final delivery |
| veo-3.1-fast-generate-001 | Fast | Rapid iteration, social media drafts, testing compositions |
## Structured Prompting (JSON)
For complex commercial workflows, use JSON structure:
```json
{
  "project_meta": {
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "resolution": "1080p",
    "model": "veo-3.1-generate-001"
  },
  "scene": {
    "cinematography": "Macro lens, slow orbit 360 degrees",
    "subject": "Artisan coffee cup, steam rising in spiral patterns",
    "action": "Hand enters frame, gentle grip, lifting slowly",
    "context": "Minimalist white studio, softbox lighting from above",
    "style": "Premium commercial aesthetic, shallow depth of field",
    "audio": "Ceramic on ceramic sound, gentle sip, ambient cafe hum"
  },
  "timeline": [
    {"time": "0-3s", "focus": "Product detail, steam physics"},
    {"time": "3-6s", "focus": "Hand interaction, human element"},
    {"time": "6-8s", "focus": "Logo reveal, satisfying audio punctuate"}
  ]
}
```
## Technical Constraints
 * **Prompt limit:** 2,000 characters
 * **Image input:** Maximum 20MB (JPEG/PNG) for Ingredients to Video
 * **Audio:** Generate natively or add post-production; Veo audio works best with clear, brief dialogue (1-2 sentences max)
 * **Text rendering:** Veo struggles with legible text; avoid critical text overlays or specify "stylized unreadable text"
 * **Concurrent requests:** 50 per minute per region (free tier)
## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| **Blurry motion** | Add "sharp motion capture, 1/1000s shutter freeze" or "slow-motion 240fps" |
| **Character inconsistency** | Use Ingredients to Video with reference images; anchor with unique clothing/jewelry |
| **Unwanted morphing** | Specify rigidity: "maintains solid form", "no deformation"; use negative prompting |
| **Physics look artificial** | Explicitly state "realistic physics", "accurate weight and momentum" |
| **Audio out of sync** | Use timestamp markers: "dialogue starts at 2s", "sound matches impact at 4s" |
| **Flat lighting** | Specify contrast: "dramatic side lighting", "deep shadows", "rim light separation" |
| **Boring composition** | Lead with dynamic camera: "whip pan", "aggressive tracking shot", "rapid dolly in" |
